## üåü Features

## üèóÔ∏è Monorepo Structure
This project adopts a monorepo approach, meaning multiple related services are housed within a single repository. This setup allows for shared configurations, dependencies, and tooling across all microservices, providing a cohesive development experience.

A monorepo facilitates:

- Single-point dependency management using PNPM workspaces.
- Shared linting, building, and testing configurations for consistency.
- Streamlined CI/CD pipelines with service-specific and global configuration options.


## üìã Prerequisites

- **Node.js (LTS version)**
    - Visit [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install.
    - Confirm installation with `$ node -v`.
- **NVM (Node Version Manager) (optional)**
    - Visit [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
    - Confirm installation with `$ nvm -v`.
    - Use `nvm use` to switch to the project's Node.js version(`~/.nvrmrc`)
- **PNPM (Package Manager)**
    - Install PNPM globally with `$ npm install -g pnpm`.
    - Confirm installation with `$ pnpm -v`.
- **Serverless Framework (To be confirmed)**
  - Install Serverless Framework globally with `$ npm install -g serverless`.
  - Confirm installation with `$ serverless -v`.
- **TypeScript**
    - Install TypeScript globally with `$ npm install -g typescript`.
    - Verify installation with `$ tsc -v`.
- An IDE that supports TypeScript (e.g., Jetbrains Webstorm, Visual Studio Code).
- Access to AWS Bedrock and other AWS srevices

## üöÄ Setup & Installation

### 1. üîó **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/colemvnio/genai-services.git
$ cd genai-services
```

### 2. üì¶ **Install Dependencies:**

Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary packages:

```bash
$ pnpm install
```

### 3. üõ†Ô∏è **Environment Configuration:**

### 4. üöÄ **Launch the Project:**

## üîß Usage

This monorepo contains scripts configured for ease of use across all services:

> To filter by a service, use `pnpm --filter<service-name> <command>`.

### Building Services

To build all services, run:

```bash
$ pnpm run build
```

This command triggers the TypeScript compiler for each service and outputs the transpiled code to the respective `dist` directories.

### Linting Services

To lint all services, use:

```bash
$ pnpm run lint
```

For automated lint fixes:

```bash
$ pnpm run lint-fix
```

### Running Tests

To execute tests across all services, run:

```bash
$ pnpm run test
```

## üß™ Testing

Each microservice includes its own tests. To run tests for a specific service, navigate to the service's directory and use the test script:

```bash
$ cd services/applicationService
$ pnpm run test
```

      - integration           # Contains integration tests for testing the integration points of the service, like external API calls.
        - integration.spec.ts # Tests the service as a whole, ensuring all components work together correctly.
      /helpers                # Service-specific test helpers for the Bedrock service.
        - bedrockHelpers.ts   # Utility functions and mocks tailored for testing the Bedrock service.
